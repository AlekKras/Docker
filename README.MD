# Docker Funzies

Docker is a great tool. In this repo I usually put all tools that I love to use.

## Little help

If you are wondering what to do, just try to install Docker (for this reason, visit `/InstallDocker`)

Then, remember those two commands:

- In order to build the image, run the following:

```
docker build -t "funzy_test" .
```

- In order to run, run the following:

```
docker run -it funzy_test bash
```
