In order to start the Docker image, need to concentrate on how to create a pre-built image. In order to do that for Node.js, we can use the base image called <code>node:7-alpine</code>. One of the folders where we can put it is <code>/src/app</code>. Let's do that by making the folder and putting it as a working directory. We would need to execute commands such as <code>FROM</code> to explain where we get our base image, <code>RUN</code> to run commands, and <code>WORKDIR</code> to show what is the working directory. Let's do it!
